# Historic Sites
The Historic Sites Web Application is a full-stack web application that displays and manages information about historic sites using dynamic server-side rendering and a PostgreSQL database. The project focuses on structured data retrieval, validation, and presentation, demonstrating full-stack development principles, SQL querying, and clear technical documentation.

This application was developed as part of the Computer Programming & Analysis program at Seneca Polytechnic and follows Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Agile development practices.

Live Demo:
🔗 https://historic-sites-gamma.vercel.app/

# Features
- Server-side rendering using EJS templates
- Backend built with Node.js and Express.js
- PostgreSQL database integration for structured data storage
- SQL queries for accurate data retrieval and validation
- Responsive UI styled with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI
- Organized and maintainable project structure

# Requirements
- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- PostgreSQL
- npm

# Steps
Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/leezacodes/historic-sites.git```

Navigate to the project directory:
```cd historic-sites```

Install dependencies:
```npm install```

Configure your PostgreSQL database credentials (environment variables or configuration file).
Start the server:
```node server.js```

Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8080

# Usage
Once the server is running:
- The application retrieves historic site data from the PostgreSQL database.
- Data is dynamically rendered using EJS templates.
- Users can view structured information about historic sites through a clean, responsive interface.

This project demonstrates backend data handling, SQL validation, and server-side rendering rather than end-user data entry.
